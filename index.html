        <p>
            I am a musician, teacher and now an aspiring web developer in Dallas, Texas. Musically I enjoy playing jazz
            and blues, as well as writing in many styles.
            I have been teaching for over 5 years, and have taught students of all ages at several studios. I have
            played in several bands in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and enjoy collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a developer I hope to bring creative and logical solutions to my workplace. I also would like to bring my
            spirit of teamwork and collaboration that I have learned from working in bands to the tech field.
            As an active learner I am looking forward to learning more everyday throughout my career.
